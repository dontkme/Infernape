## Installation

You can install the development version of Infernape from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kangbw702/Infernape")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. The data used for this example can be downloaded from http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-merge.html

```{r example}
library(Infernape)

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
